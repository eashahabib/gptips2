# gptips2_hybrid

This a GP with an optimisation scheme implemented into it. This was to study the effect of it on the performance of the GP. 

The original GP is an open source code by GPTIPS by Dom Searson. (https://sites.google.com/site/gptips4matlab/about?authuser=0)

The optimisation schemes uses multicomplex number algebra using a class developed by Jose M V Casado and Rob Hewson (Algorithm 1008: Multicomplex Number Class for Matlab, with a Focus on the Accurate Calculation of Small Imaginary Terms for Multicomplex Step Sensitivity Calculations: https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3378542)
